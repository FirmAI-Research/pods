    "# 11.2 The XML Data Format\n",
    "\n",
    "**XML**, which stands for eXtensible Markup Language, is another way to represent hierarchical data. The basic building block of XML is the **tag**, denoted by angle brackets `<>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a data set of movies might be represented using XML as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<movies>\n",
    "  <movie id=\"1\" title=\"The Godfather\">\n",
    "    <director id=\"50\" name=\"Coppola, Francis Ford\">\n",
    "    </director>\n",
    "    <releasedate>1972-03-24</releasedate>\n",
    "    <character id=\"100\" name=\"Vito Corleone\">\n",
    "      <actor id=\"200\" name=\"Brando, Marlon\">\n",
    "      </actor>\n",
    "    </character>\n",
    "    <character id=\"101\" name=\"Michael Corleone\">\n",
    "      <actor id=\"201\" name=\"Pacino, Al\">\n",
    "      </actor>\n",
    "    </character>\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "  </movie>\n",
    "  <movie id=\"2\" title=\"The Godfather: Part II\">\n",
    "    <director id=\"50\" name=\"Coppola, Francis Ford\">\n",
    "    </director>\n",
    "    <releasedate>1974-10-20</releasedate>\n",
    "    <character id=\"101\" name=\"Michael Corleone\">\n",
    "      <actor id=\"201\" name=\"Pacino, Al\">\n",
    "      </actor>\n",
    "    </character>\n",
    "    <character id=\"100\" name=\"Vito Corleone\">\n",
    "      <actor id=\"250\" name=\"De Niro, Robert\">\n",
    "      </actor>\n",
    "    </character>\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "  </movie>\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "</movies>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the following features of XML:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every tag `<a>` has a corresponding closing tag `</a>`. You can always recognize a closing tag by the forward slash `/`.\n",
    "- Additional tags and/or strings can be nested between the opening and closing tags. In the example above, `<actor>` is nested between `<character>` and `</character>`, and `<character>` is nested between `<movie>` and `</movie>`. The nesting is used to represent hierarchy.\n",
    "- Indentation is used to make the code more readable (to make it easier to see the nesting structure). But it is optional.\n",
    "- Attributes can be associated with each tag, like `id=` and `name=` with the `<character>` tag and `id=` and `title=` with the `<movie>` tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tag represents a variable in the data set. Unlike JSON, which uses lists to represent repeated fields, XML represents repeated fields by simply repeating tags where necessary. In the example above, there are multiple instances of `<movie>` within `<movies>` and multiple instances of `<character>` within `<movie>`, so `movie` and `character` are both repeated fields. (In fact, `director` is also a repeated field, but it is impossible to tell from the code above, since the movies shown above only have one director.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn XML by working with a data set of programs by the New York Philharmonic (one of the leading orchestras in the world). First, let's take a peek at the data."
